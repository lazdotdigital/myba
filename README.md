This is an extremely basic 2 player online game.

## How to play

Player one moves with WASD, player 2 moves with UHJK.

Once both players are either horizontally or vertically aligned, the last player that moved that presses space wins.

# How to connect

Run the server (ensure you have the environment variable PORT set),
then run the client passing the server URL as the first argument.
